# Overall Comments

## Lesson 1
I like
- workspace provided by udacity for first project. Made getting started really easy by not having to run anything on local
- short videos make it easy to consume content at a casual pace

I dislike
- depth of videos
- some parts of projects use concepts that weren't covered in the videos
- wtf 
  - Since this is a subset of the much larger dataset, the solution dataset will only have 1 row with values for value containing ID for both songid and artistid in the fact table.
  - Those are the only 2 values that the query in the sql_queries.py will return that are not-NONE. The rest of the rows will have NONE values for those two variables. "
